# javidcode.github.io

# forked with javid repo
#made changes to video elements, so that they are resonsive.
#one issure remaining, that is within the floats.  on full screen, floats are interfereing with view.
# adjust the floats and this should be the only fix left.  
#note: javid, there is a lot of float classes within bootstrap and your css, i thought you would be familiar with your stying
and having a quicker awareness, on which elements float is causing the issue, i would minimize the float class to one or two, this would
make troubleshooting a lot easier.  I hope this helps.  eej
